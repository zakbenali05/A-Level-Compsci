The benefits, limtations and risks of image recognition:

**Travel and tourism**
     - There are many benefits of fast image recognition in travel and tourism. For example, it can have application in the security side of travel. In airports,
     having image recognition can decrease the likeliness of an attack, as devices can use image recognition as a mechanism to spot unusual behaviour. Another
     benefit of fast image recognition is personalisation. In hotels and other companies, you can use facial recognition to match real world faces to faces 
     stored in the database, allowing for quicker and easier services tailored to the visitors. For example, during the booking process, there could be the option
     to add a picture of yourself. This then allows the camera to scan a visitor upon arrival, and instantly match it to the database. Once the face is matched, 
     the receptionists can greet the visitor straight away by name, and already know their preferences, for a quicker and easier service. However, there are also 
     some limitations and risks to the uses of image recognition in travel. For example, the technology can't yet see through opaque objects. This means that if
     an object is obstructed or hidden in a bag, the camera wouldn't pick it up. This could lead to a risk that you wouldn't be able to tell 
     whether a person is walking around with a weapon is concealed or not.
