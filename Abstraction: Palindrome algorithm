---> How to decide wether **RACECAR** is a palindrome or not:
     - **RACECAR** has an odd number of letters, therefore you compare each letter til there is one letter left.
     - First, compare the first and last letters. Are they the same: *TRUE* [The letter R and R are the same]
     - Then compare the second and second last letters. Are they the same: *TRUE* [The letter A and A are the same]
     - Then compare the third and third last letters. Are they the same: *TRUE* [The letter C and C are the same]
     - There is now one letter left, so the comaprisons stop.
     
     > **RACECAR is a palindrome, because each comparison was true.
     
---> How to decide wether **DEFIED** is a palindrome or not:
     - **DEFIED** has an even number of letters, therefore you compare each letter til there is one letter left.
     - First, compare the first and last letters. Are they same: *TRUE* [The letter D and D are the same]
     - Then compare the second and second last letter. Are they the same: *TRUE* [The letter E and E are the same]
     - Then compare the third and third last letter. Are they the same: *FALSE* [The letter I and E aren't the same]
     - All the letters have now been compared.
     
     > **DEFIED** is not a palindrome because not all the comparisons were true.
     
---> Algorithm to decide wether any word is a palindrome or not:
     - Ask for and input from the user. [The input would be a word]
     - Work out how many letters are in this word.
          > If it has an odd number of letters, you compare each letter to the opposite side until there is one letter left.
          > If it has an even number of letters, you compare each letter to the opposite side until there are no letters left.
     - When you start checking the word, you'd start by comparing the first and last letter,
     - Then you'd compare the second and second last letter, then the third and third last letter, and so on. 
     - When comparing each letter, you'd check to see whether they are the same letter or not.
          > If they are the same, then the outcome is TRUE.
          > If they aren't the same, then the outcome is FALSE.
     - For a word to be a palindrome, each comparison's outcome has to be TRUE, otherwise the word isn't a palindrome.
