Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudines; characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell, developed from their ribs. Turtles were historically considered to be the last surviving members of Anapsida but more recent studies place them with other modern reptiles in Diapsida, usually closer to Archosauria (crocodilians and birds[a]) than Lepidosauria (tuataras, lizards and snakes). There are 356 living species of turtles and include tortoises and terrapins. They are widely distributed across the world's continents and oceans.

Turtles are the only vertebrates with a complete shell. It is formed mainly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace, while the underside is the flatter plastron or belly-plate. Its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin, the material of hair and fingernails. The carapace bones develop from ribs which grow sideways and develop into broad flat plates that join up to cover the body. Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally; the sea turtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach, sometimes traveling thousands of kilometers to feed before returning to the beach where they were born. It is not known how they navigate, though they do have a magnetic sense. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the Pleurodira (side necked turtles) and Cryptodira (hidden neck turtles) which differ in the way the head is retracted.
